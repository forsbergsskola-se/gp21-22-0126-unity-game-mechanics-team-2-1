Forsbergs GP21: Unity Game Mechanics - Team 2


Sami Olsson: Dash Mechanic 

Immediate Dash
First dash I used by pressing the SHIFT key and is an immediate dash with set velocity and time.After it's been used once you have to touch the ground for it to be used again.

Dash Pad
This is simple pad placed on the ground that will boost the players movement speed and give them a slight push up in the air. Once you hit the ground the speed of the player will reset to default.


Efraim Kent: Fly Mechanic

Jetpack
Activates by pressing E, powers UP and DOWN with W and A respectively and deactivates with another press of E. Deactivates the Player Rigidbody's "gravity" and applies velocity to simulate flying. Only activates when the player isn's already flying and disables the player's jump ability.

Hover Power-up
Activates when colliding with a trigger object and let's the player hover slightly for a moment.
